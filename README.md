## Big Data Applications in Finance (Course material)

Hi everyone, 

This is some of the material I covered last year for my course of "Big Data Applications in Finance". The course cover nine topics. Topics are the following:

* Introduction to the module an MatlabWeek 
* Introduction to Machine LearningWeek 
* Credit risk models 
* Penalised regressions
* Asset Management I
* Asset Management II
* Text as data and Sparse portfolios
* Unsupervised learningWeek 
* Large-scale learning

Together with the slides you will find some tutorials in Matlab (I know, next year will be Python :)). I also include an assignment which may be used to test the understanding of the coding. 

Enjoy the material

Daniele
