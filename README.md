# ECOM151_2020

Hi everyone, 

This is some of the material I covered last year for my course of "Big Data Applications in Finance". The course cover nine topics. Topics are the following:

1:Introduction to the module an MatlabWeek 
2:Introduction to Machine LearningWeek 
3:Credit risk models 
4:Penalised regressions
5:Asset Management I
6:Asset Management II
7:Text as data and Sparse portfolios
8:Unsupervised learningWeek 
9:Large-scale learning

Together with the slides you will find some tutorials in Matlab (I know, next year will be Python :)). I also include an assignment which may be used to test the understanding of the coding. 

Enjoy the material
